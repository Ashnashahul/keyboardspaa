# Keyboard Spa 


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Useless Duo


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Ashna Shahul - College Of Engineering And Management Punnapra
- Member 2:  Abhirami K - College Of Engineering And Management Punnapra

### Project Description
A totally unnecessary yet oddly satisfying virtual keyboard spa that pretends to deep-clean your keyboard whenever you press a key. It splashes bubbles, plays quirky sounds, and celebrates with sparkles ‚Äî all without removing a single crumb from your real keyboard.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Millions of keyboards around the world suffer from a lack of pampering. While humans enjoy spa days, our keyboards are forced to endure greasy fingers and coffee spills with no self-care routine.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Introducing Keyboard Spa üåä‚ú® ‚Äî a browser-based ‚Äúkeyboard cleaner‚Äù that plays bubbly sounds, animates cleaning effects, and declares your keyboard ‚Äúclean‚Äù after a 10-second luxurious wash cycle. Absolutely no germs are harmed, but your serotonin levels may rise.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used

-Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (WebAudio API)
